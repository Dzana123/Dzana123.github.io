            <h2>General</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Yana Eftimova, and I'm a dedicated student at FINKI with a passion for Game Design and 3D Animation. From a young age, I've been captivated by the world of 3D animation, inspired by watching Disney and Pixar movies and spending my days playing video games. I've always been curious about how these captivating creations are made, which led me to delve deeper into this industry.  Below, I've shared my experiences from two academies and my journey of growth:</p>

            <h2>IThink Academy - Year 1</h2>
            <p>In 2016, I enrolled at IThink Academy. During that year, our curriculum covered foundational computer skills, including HTML, Photoshop, Scratch, and working with robots. At the age of 12, many of the specific details have faded from memory, but what remains vivid is the enjoyment I experienced and the friendships I forged along the way.</p>

            <h2>IThink Academy - Year 2</h2>
            <p>During the second year, our focus shifted towards preparing for a competition known as CodeFest, hosted in Ohrid. We were divided into several teams, and I was part of a team tasked with developing a website for communication purposes. Throughout this period, we delved deeper into web development techniques and honed our skills in photo editing using Photoshop. I took on the role of presenting for my team, and despite not winning, the experience was incredibly rewarding and enjoyable.</p>

            <h2>IThink Academy - Year 3</h2>
            <p>In our third year, we delved deeper into Game Design, immersing ourselves in Unreal Engine. This year proved to be particularly memorable for me, fueling my passion for Game Design even further. We tackled various projects such as creating pinball games, developing textures, working with blueprints, and crafting an adventure game. Although memories from my time in the academy have faded over the years, these experiences were undeniably enjoyable and instrumental in shaping my interests.</p>

            <h2>M3DS Academy</h2>
            <p>The year I spent at M3DS Academy was pivotal in nurturing my passion for Game Design and Animation. Enrolling in 2022, I sought to expand my skills and experiences, and the academy did not disappoint. Throughout the year, we extensively used Autodesk Maya, ZBrush, Substance Painter, and other essential applications. I engaged in various projects, which you can explore further by hovering over the photo and clicking "See More," directing you to my portfolio page.</p>
